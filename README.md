# 3-bit-count
The LED’s will display the value of internal “3-bit count”.
Use two push buttons and three LEDs for this circuit. The push buttons will change an internal “3-bit
count”. 

The LED’s will display the value of this internal “3-bit count”.

* One push button will increment the 3-bit count. This is the “up button”.

* The other push button should decrement the 3-bit count. This is the “down button”.

* The 3-bit count value will be displayed on the three LEDs in binary

* one LED per binary digit

* a binary digit of 1 is indicated when the LED is on
